Example of RxJava with MVP architecture
=================

This project is a example of how to implement the MVP architecture with RxJava in kotlin.

Libraries Used
--------------

* [RxJava][0] - RxJava is a Java VM implementation of Reactive Extensions: a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.
* [RxAndroid][1] - This module adds the minimum classes to RxJava that make writing reactive components in Android applications easy and hassle-free. More specifically, it provides a Scheduler that schedules on the main thread or any given Looper.
* [RxKotlin][2] - RxKotlin is a lightweight library that adds convenient extension functions to RxJava.
* [Paging v3][3] - The Paging library helps you load and display pages of data from a larger dataset from local storage or over network.
* [Dagger 2][4] -Dagger is a fully static, compile-time dependency injection framework for both Java and Android.
